## ClientGetDealInfo 

This method will return information on the status of a deal you have proposed with a miner. It takes in the CID you received when you ran used the `ClientStartDeal` method. 

Here's an example: 

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:1234/rpc/v0' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR ADMIN TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "Filecoin.ClientGetDealInfo",
    "params": [
        {
            "/": "bafy2bzacea3wsdh6y3a36tb3skempjoxqpuyompjbmfeyf34fi3uy6uue42v4"
        }
    ],
    "id": 3
}'
```

The response will look something like this: 

```
{
  "ProposalCid": {
    "/": "bafy2bzacea3wsdh6y3a36tb3skempjoxqpuyompjbmfeyf34fi3uy6uue42v4"

One of the more difficult things when using the Filecoin API is understanding your deal proposal's status. To make things simple in this documentation, there are two codes you'll want to know about explicitly. 

A `State` of 26 means your deal failed. You should be able to see some additional information about the failure reason within the response here. A `State` of 7 means your deal was successful and should now be on-chain. 

If you see a deal `State` of 7, you are safe to record the `PieceCID` as you main reference point for the deal. Fortunately, if you want a better representation of the deal's status, you can simply use the `ClientGetDealStatus` method and pass in the `State` code you received.
