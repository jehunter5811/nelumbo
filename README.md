# Nelumbo 

Nelumbo is a one-click, development blockchain for Filecoin that you can run on your Mac. Rather than spending time with dependencies, version management, and command-line difficulties, you can launch a development version of the Filecoin Lotus blockchain. This let's you get to the important stuff fasterâ€”building.

## Project Status  

Nelumbo is under active development. Contributions are welcome. Please open issues, create pull requests, and reach out if you have questions. 

##  Who is behind this project  

Justin Hunter (known on the web as [polluterofminds](https://polluterofminds.com)) is building this. He has been working on Filecoin storage client development since the early days of Testnet. This project solves a big problem for him, and it will surely solve a big problem for you if you're building storage client apps.
