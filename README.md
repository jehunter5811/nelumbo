# Nelumbo 

Nelumbo is a one-click, development blockchain for Filecoin that you can run on your Mac. Rather than spending time with dependencies, version management, and command-line difficulties, you can launch a development version of the Filecoin Lotus blockchain. This let's you get to the important stuff fasterâ€”building.

## Project Status  

Nelumbo is under active development. Contributions are welcome. Please open issues, create pull requests, and reach out if you have questions. 

The current state is such that you can run the app and it will start a running local devnet. There is not much UI built out around it yet, but there are status updates displayed in-app. 

##  Who is behind this project  

Justin Hunter (known on the web as [polluterofminds](https://polluterofminds.com)) is building this. He has been working on Filecoin storage client development since the early days of Testnet. This project solves a big problem for him, and it will surely solve a big problem for you if you're building storage client apps.
