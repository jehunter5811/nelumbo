# Nelumbo 

Nelumbo is a one-click, development blockchain for Filecoin that you can run on your Mac. Rather than spending time with dependencies, version management, and command-line difficulties, you can launch a development version of the Filecoin Lotus blockchain. This let's you get to the important stuff fasterâ€”building.

You can verify the validity of the app by ensuring the hash is `Qmd3Y2RkarPyHVrAyoLYfhEi5Amkn7iqUyvXUsEDCTRkpG`.

## Project Status  

Nelumbo is designed to make getting a local Filecoin devnet spun up easily, but it also provides some nice-to-have tools including: 

* A simple block explorer 
* Wallet creation 
* HTTP API documentation around key methods

Should you find any issues with the application, please open issues in this repository. Pull requests are welcome. 

## Requirements  

While Nelumbo tries to abstract away all of the dependency installation requirements, there is one dependency that is required. Users will need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

##  Who is behind this project  

Justin Hunter ([polluterofminds](https://polluterofminds.com)) is building this. He has been working on Filecoin storage client development since the early days of Testnet. This project solves a big problem for him, and it will surely solve a big problem for you if you're building storage client apps. 

**Nelumbo uses [Exceptionless](https://exceptionless.com) to capture error information to help better support users of the app.**
